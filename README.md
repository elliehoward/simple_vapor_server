# Simple_vapor_server
###A guide to building a simple server in swift with vapor

###Prerequisite skills/knowledge:

This tutorial is for those who have experience developing in Javascript and have built CRUD applications in a language other than swift.

You should also be familiar with the [command line](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) in the Terminal.

A basic knowledge of [Model View Controller](https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/) pattern.

The purpose of this tutorial is learning to use vapor with swift. While you do NOT need to USE XCode for this particular tutorial, you do need to [begin downloading it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) now in order to use swift. After it has downloaded, open it to begin the installation. I recommend looking into it because it is a useful environment to experiment with swift in.
